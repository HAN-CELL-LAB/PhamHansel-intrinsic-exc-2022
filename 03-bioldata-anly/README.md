# Biological data analysis

## Disclaimer

Please excuse some of the ways I organized the data folder and how I named them. Things changed over time and decisions were made that I did not have the time to re-organize and re-run to make sure everything is tip-top and clean. Just email or raise an issue if there needs to be any clarification.

## V1 data

This was obtained from communication with the authors of the following paper, hence no data will be committed to the `data/v1-data` folder of the data repository. Please contact the authors of the following paper directly for the data.

## S1 data

These data were obtained in the Hansel lab, from the following paper by Gill & Hansel 2020, as well as additional recordings (prefixes TP: Tuan Pham, SEB: Silas Busch, CH: Christian Hansel). All data were committed in the data repository (refer to the main `README.md` file) but only selected data were analyzed due to the quality of recordings and cell healths.

The IP data are in `data/gill-data` (for the previous paper) and `data/supp-data` (additional recordings of oxo-m and oxo-m + somatic depolarization conditions). The 4 recordings to estimate the threshold upper bounds (using "refractory thresholds" as mentioned in the manuscript) are in `data/extra-data` (combined from `data/{pham-data,hansel-data}`).
