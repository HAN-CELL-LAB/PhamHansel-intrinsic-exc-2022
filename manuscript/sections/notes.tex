\section{\textit{Notes on notes}}

\quad \NEWCHANGE{New text change is underline italic}; but because it's not very easy with underlining with citation in latex so new text is just italic like this:
    \NEWCHANGE{synaptic plasticity exists}
    \NEWCITE{\citep[LTP;][]{Bliss1973-od,Nabavi2014-fn}} \NEWCHANGE{probably}.

\quad \NEWCHANGEUNSURE{New change integrated but unsure, need further discussion, see their footnotes}. Sometimes it's just the same text but redded to indicate need for discussion or clarification in the footnote.

\quad \TOREMOVE{Texts To be removed looks like this, usually because involving supplemental figures}. However, sometimes the there will be footnote stating I'm unsure how to keep the statements without keeping such supp references. The supp figs are still attached here to compare.

\quad \FIGNEWNOTE{Figure notes look like this, but will not be integrated into final text}.
