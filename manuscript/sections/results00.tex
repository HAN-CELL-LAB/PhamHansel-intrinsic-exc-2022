\subsection{Threshold decrease results in a reduced ability to discriminate distinct input patterns}
It is expected that
    \NEWCHANGE{threshold plasticity,
        when taking place close to the soma
        and therefore ``downstream'' of dendritic input locations,
         indistinctively amplifies synaptic responses.}
    This downstream amplification may lead to reduced resolution
        and thus a decrease in the ability to discriminate input patterns.
    To quantitatively describe this effect, we model a two-layer feedforward network (\autoref{fig:discrim})
        and inspect the output discriminability via output pattern distributions
        and pairwise distance for both random (initial) and optimized states (via Euclidean loss, see Methods).

Across a wide range of values of $N_X, N_Y$, we observe that
        the effects of threshold change in the output layer $\Delta \theta$
        on the number of unique output patterns and on output entropy
        in the random initial states
        are generally symmetric.
    The optimization process via minimization of the Euclidean loss for output patterns
        results in a small decrease in the output thresholds,
        creating the asymmetry in the peak values of the output entropy and pattern number
            (as a function of $\Delta \theta$ to shift to the right),
        especially for small $N_Y$.
    The $\Delta \theta$ for the peak values in these curves tends towards positive change,
        exemplifying how decreased thresholds may harm discriminability.

Another way to quantify discriminability is to look at the pairwise distances between the binary output patterns
        using known distance measures such as
            the Jaccard distances $J_d$
            or the normalized Hamming distances $H_d$
            (\autoref{fig:discrim}b-d).
    Instead of observing these distances for all input patterns, we choose
        a minimal common input activation number $k$,
        to parameterize input overlap when quantifying output discriminability.
    The relationship between these distances and threshold changes is shown in \autoref{fig:discrim}c,d for the optimized states.

Decreases in thresholds, for both cases, increase output activity as expected
        but decrease the binary distances $J_d$ and $H_d$,
        for different values of input pattern with minimal similarity $k$.
    As $k$ increases, the resulting output patterns become less distinguishable and $\Delta \theta < 0$ worsens the outcome.
    On the other hand, when $\Delta \theta > 0$, the effects still hold mainly for Jaccard distances,
        as they are more biased towards activated units.
    The dependence of the normalized Hamming distances on $\Delta \theta$ is nonmonotonic
        (illustrated in \autoref{fig:discrim}b)
        as sparsification of output activity by a large threshold increase would eventually decrease pattern differences.
    Together, these considerations exemplify how detrimental it is for discrimination performance when output thresholds decrease.
