    \textit{Recognition performance curves, tradeoffs between true and false positive rates; along with ROC of recognition rates}.
    (\textbf{a})
        Recognition TPR (blue), FPR (red) and tradeoff (i.e. TPR $-$ FPR in green) curves
            depend on threshold changes (x-axis),
            input completeness (shading, see color bars)
            and selectivity setup (different panels).
    (\textbf{b}) Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of recognition
        with TPR and FPR in panel (a) plotted against each other
        with shadings indicating input completeness
        (sub-panel layout is the same as panel a).
