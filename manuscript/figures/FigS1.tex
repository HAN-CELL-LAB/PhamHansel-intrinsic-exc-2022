    \textit{Discrimination task: changes in entropy and reduction of Euclidean loss}.
    (\textbf{a-b})
        Example of the progress in optimization tracking the Euclidean loss (black)
        and selecting for the \textbf{\textit{best}} entropy value in the output layer patterns (\textit{a}$_1$),
        with the initial and best weight matrices shown in
            (\textit{a}$_2$, heatmaps show the weights between inputs and outputs)
        and output thresholds in (\textit{a}$_3$).
        The effects of $\Delta \theta$ on the entropy
            and number of unique output patterns are shown in (\textit{b}$_1,2$).
    (\textbf{c}) For a fixed 10 $X's$ with different $N_Y$ (colors),
        the network properties (weights, thresholds) are shown against each other
            and against the maximum entropy/number of unique patterns
            due to $\Delta \theta$.
        $\Delta \theta_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the threshold change
            where the values (entropy or \# unique) are maximum.
        Note that the \textit{init}-$W$ is constant at 0.1
            because of the L1 normalization.
