    \textit{Recognition performance based on the change of threshold in a single output unit}.
    (\textbf{a})
        The recognition trade off (TPR $-$ FPR; shades of red)
        and recognition true-positive rate (TPR; shades of blue)
        as a function of threshold change ($\Delta\theta$).
        Increasing selectivity indices ($\alpha_W$) are shown from left to right.
        Two conditions of selectivity overlap are shown from top to bottom.
        Darker shades represent more complete patterns.
    (\textbf{b})
        Demonstration of how $\Delta \theta_{\mathrm{optim}}$ is obtained,
        as the threshold change with the smallest absolute value to achieve maximal performance.
    (\textbf{c})
        $\Delta \theta_{\mathrm{optim}}$ of recognition TPR (\textbf{c}$_1$)
        and tradeoff (TPR $-$ FPR, \textbf{c}$_2$)
        as a function of input completeness (y-axis)
        and selectivity setup (strength/index: grey shadings; overlap: top vs bottom).
